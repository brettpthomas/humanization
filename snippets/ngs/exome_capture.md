In the context of exome sequencing, an exome capture *kit* describes the set of regions that undergo sequencing. 
Ideally this would just be the set of exons in the genome, 
but there are some genes that are hard to capture, 
and capture kits someties include other regions of interest that aren't necessarily protein coding (for example HLA region). 
Further, a capture kit must provide "padding" on each side of a region that you want to sequence.
